 Printer Use 9600 Baud rate.

The printer can print ASCII characters.

The communication is very easy, we can print anything by simply using UART, transmitting string or character.

The printer works from 5-9V, we will use a 9V 2A power supply which can power both the printer and the Arduino Uno. The printer needs more than 1.5A of current for heating the printer head. This is the drawback of the thermal printer as it takes huge load current during the printing process.
